## Overview

Using datasets from the links provided below, I found the dataset containing breweries across the United States and a dataset containing over 1.5 million reviews of beers. I merged the two datasets together creating a beer_df. This was then used to create a beer recommender system using multiple machine learning models and filtering techniques.

## Introduction

This project is a culmination of the skills I have learned in the Flatiron School Data Science program. The goal of this project is to create a model that can predict the overall rating of a beer based on the beer's style, brewery, and review.
