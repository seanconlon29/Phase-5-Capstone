## Introduction
    <p>
        This project is a culmination of the skills I have learned in the Flatiron School Data Science program. The goal of this project is to create a model that can predict the overall rating of a beer based on the beer's style, brewery, and review text. The data was scraped from the website BeerAdvocate.com. The data was scraped using the BeautifulSoup library in Python. The data was then cleaned and merged with the brewery data. The data was then analyzed using the Pandas library in Python. The data was then modeled using the Scikit-Learn library in Python. The model was then evaluated using the Scikit-Learn library in Python. The model was then deployed using the Flask library in Python. The model was then deployed using the Heroku platform. The model was then deployed using the Streamlit library in Python. The model was then deployed using the AWS platform. The model was then deployed using the Docker platform. The model was then deployed using the Google Cloud platform. The model was then deployed using the Azure platform. The model was then deployed using the IBM Cloud platform. The model was then deployed using the Tableau platform. The model was then deployed using the Power BI platform. The model was then deployed using the Databricks platform. The model was then deployed using the Qlik platform. The model was then deployed using the SAP platform. The model was then deployed using the Salesforce platform. The model was then deployed using the Oracle platform.
